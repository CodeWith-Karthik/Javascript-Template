// Datatypes
// Javascript is Dynamic Typing
// Primitive and Object Type

//Primitive Data Types
//1.Number - Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

//2.String - Represents a sequence of characters.

//3.Boolean - Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

//4.Undefined - A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

//5.Null - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

//6.Symbol - Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.

//7.BigInt - Represents whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1 (the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number type).

//Non-Primitive Data Types
//1.Object
/*Represents a collection of properties, each consisting of a key (usually a string) 
and a value (which can be any data type, including another object).*/

//2.Array
//A special type of object used for storing ordered collections of values.

//3.Function
//A special type of object that is callable and can perform an action.

//4.Date - A built-in object for handling dates and times.
